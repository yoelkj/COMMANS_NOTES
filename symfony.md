The Security component is divided into several smaller sub-components which can be used separately:


symfony/security-core
It provides all the common security features, from authentication to authorization and from encoding 
passwords to loading users.


symfony/security-http
It integrates the core sub-component with the HTTP protocol to handle HTTP requests and responses.


symfony/security-csrf
It provides protection against CSRF attacks.


symfony/security-guard
It brings many layers of authentication together, allowing the creation of complex authentication systems.
You can install each of them separately in your project:

```bash
 composer require symfony/security-core
 composer require symfony/security-http
 composer require symfony/security-csrf
 composer require symfony/security-guard
```
